🎮 RockPaperScissors – Java Console Game
✨ Description

This is a fun and simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Java! 🖐️✊✌️
The game allows a user to play against the computer, which makes random moves. The winner is determined based on the standard rules:

✊ Rock beats Scissors

✌️ Scissors beats Paper

🖐️ Paper beats Rock

This project is a great way to learn basic Java programming concepts, including variables, loops, conditional statements, user input, and random number generation.

🛠 Features

💻 Console-based game interface

🎯 User inputs their choice:

0 for Rock ✊

1 for Paper 🖐️

2 for Scissors ✌️

🤖 Computer makes a random selection

⚠️ Handles invalid input (numbers other than 0, 1, or 2)

🔄 Detects a draw and asks the user to play again

🏆 Displays the winner after each round

🔍 How It Works

The game starts and asks the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer randomly selects one of the three options 🤖.

The program compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice.

The winner is determined according to Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

If there is a draw, the game prompts the user to play again 🔄.

The result (User Wins / Computer Wins / Draw) is displayed in the console 🏆.
