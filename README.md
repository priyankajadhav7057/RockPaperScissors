RockPaperScissors – Java Console Game
Description

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Java. The game allows a user to play against the computer. The computer makes random moves, and the game determines the winner based on the standard rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

The project demonstrates basic Java programming concepts, including variables, loops, conditional statements, user input, and random number generation.

Features

Console-based game interface

User inputs their choice:

0 for Rock

1 for Paper

2 for Scissors

Computer makes a random selection

Handles invalid user input (numbers other than 0, 1, or 2)

Detects a draw and asks the user to play again

Displays the winner after each round

How It Works

The game starts and asks the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer randomly selects one of the three options.

The program compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice.

The winner is determined according to standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

If there is a draw, the game prompts the user to play again until there is a winner.

The result (User Wins / Computer Wins / Draw) is displayed in the console.

Requirements

Java JDK 8 or higher

A console/terminal to run the program
